# zmq_proto3_cpp_example
simple example of zmq communication with proto3 serialization


If the cmake cannot find the zmq lib it's probably because you have an old version of zmq (without the cmakeFind file). So please Install from source

To run this example you need:

- https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf
- https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq
- https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq
